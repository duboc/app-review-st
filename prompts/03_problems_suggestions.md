# Enhanced Problem & Suggestion Analysis of User Reviews (Expanded)

Analyze the user reviews within the provided CSV file (containing 'content', 'score', and 'at' columns), focusing on identifying key problems, user suggestions, and their evolution over time. The analysis should deliver actionable insights for developers and product managers.

Analysis Objectives:

Negative Review Analysis:

Problem Extraction and Categorization: Extract all negative reviews (based on sentiment derived from 'content', as 'score' might be unreliable) and identify recurring complaints. Categorize these complaints into specific types, such as:

Bugs/Glitches

Feature Issues (missing features, poorly implemented features, etc.)

Performance Problems (slowness, crashes, battery drain, etc.)

Usability Issues (poor interface, confusing navigation, etc.)

Content/Quality Issues (errors, inaccuracies, etc.)

Other Issues (specify)

Frequency Analysis: Calculate and present the frequency of each problem category.

Example Reviews: For each category, select 2-3 representative example reviews, including the 'at' date for context.

Time-Based Trend Analysis: Using the 'at' column, analyze if specific problems are increasing, decreasing, or remaining constant over time. Identify trends in problem reporting.

Suggestion & Feature Request Analysis:

Suggestion Extraction and Grouping: Extract all suggestions and feature requests from the reviews (regardless of sentiment) and group them into logical themes (e.g., "New Payment Options," "Improved Search Functionality," "Customization Features").

Prioritization: Rank or prioritize these suggestions based on:

Frequency of mentions across reviews

Impact on user experience (if it can be reasonably estimated)

Example Reviews: Include example review excerpts illustrating the most popular and impactful suggestions.

Emerging Suggestion Analysis: Track if new suggestions appear over time.

Output and Reporting:

Structured Report: Generate a report that includes:

Executive Summary: A concise overview of the key findings and recommendations.

Problem Analysis Table: A table listing problem categories, frequency, example reviews (with dates), and a visual representation of time-based trends (e.g., a simple line chart or bar chart, if applicable).

Suggestion Analysis Table: A table listing grouped suggestions, frequency, estimated impact, and example reviews.

Trend Analysis Section: A written summary highlighting any important trends or patterns in problem reports or suggestions over time.

Actionable Insights: A list of concrete recommendations for development teams based on the analysis.

Visualization: If feasible, use basic charts (e.g., bar charts for problem category frequencies) or trend graphs to visually represent data and insights.

Clear and Concise Language: Use plain language suitable for developers and product stakeholders.

Bonus Points:

Sentiment Score Refinement: If the content analysis provides more accurate sentiment, consider using that instead of the existing 'score' column.

Sentiment Evolution Table: A table showing the evolution of positive, negative and neutral sentiments overtime

Impact of Changes: If the 'at' column has a granularity that enables identifying impact of app updates (or similar), try to correlate app updates to sentiment and problem changes

Example Output Snippets (Illustrative):

Problem Analysis Table:

Category	Frequency	Example Review (Date)	Trend Over Time
Bugs/Glitches	32	"App crashed repeatedly after the update." (2023-10-26) "Data loss issues." (2023-10-27)	Increasing
Feature Issues	25	"The search function doesn't work properly." (2023-10-20)	Stable
Suggestion Analysis Table:

Suggestion Group	Frequency	Estimated Impact	Example Review
Improved Search	45	High	"Needs a better way to find what I need."
New Payment Options	30	Medium	"Add PayPal support!"
Key Considerations for Implementation:

Assume the 'content' column is the primary source for text analysis.

Sentiment analysis will be used to determine whether a review is positive, negative or neutral, not relying on the given score.
